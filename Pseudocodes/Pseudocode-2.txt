In English:
reset my motors so they are both zeroed

Turn 1 degree, then check if there is a thing
If there is a thing, record its distance and amount of degrees turned
Find distance * sin(degrees) and store it in vertical distance
FInd distance * cos(degrees) and store it in horizontal distance
Keep going until I have turned 180 degrees

use vertical distances and horizontal distances to get to the object
if it is red or yellow, go behind it and push it to the start
otherwise, go back to the start
