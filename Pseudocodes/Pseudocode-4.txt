Pseudocode-4

while True:
    Turn 1 degree, then check if there is a thing
    If there is a thing, record its distance and amount of degrees turned
    Find distance * sin(degrees) and store it in vertical distance
    FInd distance * cos(degrees) and store it in horizontal distance
    record it all into a list called 'positions'
    Keep going until I have turned 180 degrees

    For every item in positions:
        Move to the vertical length (This should be vertical length - previous vertical length)
        Turn 90 degrees in the direction according to whether the horizontal distance was positive or negative
        otherwise, 
        if it is red or yellow:
            move by horizontal distance
            rotate 90 degrees (The object will bet caught between the two extended rods)
            go back to the start (previous vertical will be put back to 0)
        else:
            turn back 90 degrees and move to the next object


Modifications required:
Both protruding rods on the robot's front have been extended, make sure they are wide, and have hooks at the end of them.
