Pseudocode-3

Start
positions  = (A list)
degrees_turned = 0

def reset:
    Drivebase until both motors are both at 0 degrees

def look: 
    global degrees_turned
    while ultrasonic < 120:
        turn 1 degree clockwise
        degrees_turned += 1
        check sensors
        degress += 1
    measure distance
    store vertical = distance * sin(degrees)
    store horiznontal = distance * cos(degrees)
    if degrees_turned < 90:
        horizontal = -horizontal
    return (horizontal, vertical)


reset
turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise
while degrees_turned < 180:
    positions.append(look)
    turn 5 degrees clockwise
    degrees_turned += 5

reset
for i in range(len(positions)):
    reset
    turn clockwise(90)
    move forward (positions[i][0])
    turn anti-clockwise(90)
    move forward (positions[i][1])

    backward = 0
    if sensor not returns RED or YELLOW:
        move backward (10)
        backward += 10
    #Turn and push
    turn clockwise (180)
    move forward (positions[i][0]) - backward #If the box was not red or yellow
    turn anti-clockwise(90)
    move forward (positions[i][1])
    


In English:
reset my motors so they are both zeroed

Turn 1 degree, then check if there is a thing
If there is a thing, record its distance and amount of degrees turned
Find distance * sin(degrees) and store it in vertical distance
FInd distance * cos(degrees) and store it in horizontal distance
Keep going until I have turned 180 degrees

use vertical distances and horizontal distances to get to the object
if it is red or yellow, rotate 180 degrees (The object will bet caught between the two extended rods)
go back to the start

Modifications required:
Both protruding rods on the robot's front have been extended
