## MAIN OBJECTIVES/SUCCESS CRITERIA
We are to create a piece of code that allows a robot to go from a starting point, find a red brick and a yellow brick and bring them back to the starting point, while avoiding other different coloured bricks.
The process must be efficient. i.e. don't make the robot move randomly so that it will eventually find the bricks and bring them back.
The code should be properly formatted and readable.
The robot should be able to sense an object, move closer to said object and then check the colour of the object.
