# Behold! Our Stuff!

Welcome to our humble repository. We are focusing on EV3 micropython code. The EV3 robot contains the EV3 brick, as well as Lego Technic and robot parts. We used pybricks to help us code our EV3 robot. 

Whether the material contained within will help you or not, we hope it will interest you.
