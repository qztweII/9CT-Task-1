# Behold! Our Stuff!

Welcome to our humble repository. We are focusing on EV3 micropython code. The EV3 robot contains the EV3 brick, as well as Lego Technic and robot parts. We used pybricks to help us code our EV3 robot. 

Whether the material contained within will help you or not, we hope it will interest you.

# Info

## MAIN OBJECTIVES/SUCCESS CRITERIA

We are to create a piece of code that allows a robot to go from a starting point, find a red brick and a yellow brick and bring them back to the starting point, while avoiding other different coloured bricks. The process must be efficient. i.e. don't make the robot move randomly so that it will eventually find the bricks and bring them back. The code should be properly formatted and readable. The robot should be able to sense an object, move closer to said object and then check the colour of the object.

## In a few lines:

> Uses sensors to find boxes and identify their colour

> Be able to transport the boxes with the correct colours back to the start

> Avoid wrong coloured boxes

> The robot should be able to do this relatively quickly, with as little unnecessary distance travelled.
