*Let s be the amount of days I have worked on this project as of 12/5/2025*

# Day s
## What I have done today:
> I have updated my code to include trigonometry functions and other stuff. 
> I have also built the modification for my bot.
>>I have also realised that I may further modifications to the bot, concerning the placement of the sensors.
## What I plan to do the next day:
> Now that I have thought of it, I may need a new pseudocode
## Notes on the teammates:
> The main problem may be that Eli and I are doing two very different codes. We have two very different ideas on this.

> Time is already running out. I better finish the code by today. 
## What I plan to do the next day:
> 
## Notes on the teammates:
> Since I have not made enough progress on my code, the team has decided that Eli's code would be the better choice.
