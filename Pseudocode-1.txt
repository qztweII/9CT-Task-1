Pseudocode in first person. 

Start
Look for objects by spinning around until something comes up on ultrasonic sensors
When I find a thing on my ultrasonic sensor, I will go towards it. 
I will then turn so my colour sensor can sense it. 
If colour sensor says RED or YELLOW, I will bash it as hard as I possibly can. 
Anyhow, I will then move back a bit, then repeat the process.
