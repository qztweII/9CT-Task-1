Pseudocode in first person. 

Start
Look for objects by spinning around until something comes up on ultrasonic sensors
When I find a thing on my ultrasonic sensor, I will go towards it. 
I will then turn so my colour sensor can sense it. 
If colour sensor says RED or YELLOW, I will bash it as hard as I possibly can. (Transportation, I guess)
Anyhow, I will then move back a bit, then repeat the process. 
However, if I cannot see anything, I will move a little to the side, then try again. 






Actual pseudocode:
Start
Forever:
    If no object:
        spin (dont wait)
        while spinning:
            see if anything comes up on ultrasonic
            wait 10 ms
        spin cw 90 degrees
        move forward 20 cm
    Move forward until it is 5 cm away
    spin ccw 45 degrees
    colour sensor
    if object is RED or YELLOW:
        move back 15 cm 
        Full speed 30 cm
        stop (brake)
    reverse 10 cm
    spin cw 10 degrees
