# MAIN GOALS/SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Develop an algorithm and MicroPython program for a LEGO EV3 robot that autonomously collects and transports a red LEGO block and a yellow LEGO block to designated positions while avoiding all other blocks.
- Develop the code to be efficient. i.e. Don't just make a mess of code that makes the robot spin around randomly and complete the task given enough time.
- Utilise the two sensors provided to complete this task. (Mandatory as it is literally impossible without it)
- Create a line of code to avoid the other colours and track whether it has found the correct colours

## Day 1 - 28-03-2025
- Eli is making ideas for how the robot might detect, remember different blocks and deciding what previous tasks code we can use for inspiration. Terence had been writing a pseudocode. 

### Plans for next time
- The group should decide on how the robot will function, start refining the code and continue research task.

### Other Notes
- The blocks were shown to the class today, they were quite big compared to the map.

## Day 2 - 01-04-2025
- The group had been coming up with second ideas of how the bot will operate. We might need some intense maths or stuff, and I (Terence) have not figured out what to do if the robot detects only three objects if the farther thing gets blocked

### Plans for next time
- finish pseudocode and work more on flowgorithm

### Other Notes
- [Any miscellaneous notes, feedback, or ideas]

## Day 3 - 03-04-2025
- Eli is working on finishing pseudocode and working on ideas for the robots movement and detection code.

### Plans for next time
- finish all of the pseudocode, flowgorithm and continue with the coding and theory.

### Other Notes
- [Any miscellaneous notes, feedback, or ideas]

## Day 4 - 07-04-2025
- Eli is going to actually start coding the robot and test it

### Plans for next time
- get help for code

### Other Notes
- Eli needs the actual color of the blocks


## Day 5 - 12-04-2025
- Eli is going to continue coding and testing

### Plans for next time
- Eli finishes pseudocode

### Other Notes
- [Any miscellaneous notes, feedback, or ideas]
