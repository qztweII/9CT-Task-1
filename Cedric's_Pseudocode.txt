Solution 1

Start
Record starting position on a grid
Rotate body 30 degrees at a time
Before the next rotation, scan the area for an object using the ultrasonic sensor
If there is an object, move towards the object
Scan the colour of the object
If the object is red or yellow, push the object to starting position
Else if the object is blue or green, mark object position and move away from it
Else pass
Once object is back at starting position repeat from number three until red and yellow are at starting position

Solution 2

Start
Record starting position on a grid
Move forward to centre of the area
Rotate body 30 degrees at a time, scanning after each rotation using the ultrasonic sensor
If there is an object, move towards the object
Scan the colour of the object
If the object is red or yellow, push the object to starting position
Else if the object is blue or green, mark object position and move away from it
Else pass
Repeat from number 3 until yellow and red bricks are back at the starting position

Solution 3

Record starting position on a grid
Scan the area in front for objects
Record any object's locations on the grid
Turn 90 degrees to the left
Move forward 10 centimetres
Turn 90 degrees to the right
Move to the middle of the side
Turn 90 degrees to the right
Scan the area in front for objects
Record any object's locations on the grid
Go up to recorded objects on grid and check their colours
If the object is red or yellow, push the object to starting position
Else if the object is blue or green, mark object position and move away from it
Else pass
Repeat from number 11 until yellow and red bricks are back at the starting position
