# Project Evaluation
## Evaluation of your INDIVIDUAL Final Test Case in Relation to Functional Criteria
If the code works ideally, it should be able to complete the functional criteria. However, upon further analysis of the code, it does not have an actual way of avoiding wrong coloured boxes while the robot transports its object back to the start. This will not meet the third functional criteria in certain test cases. Although the robot may not ever have to collide with wrong coloured box, there is still a need to eliminate any chances of it doing so. 


## Evaluation of your INDIVIDUAL Final Test Case in Relation to Non-Functional Criteria
If the code works ideally, the non-functinal criteria will be met. The robot's code is designed so it locates the boxes first before moving to examine the boxes. This eliminates the need for randomly moving to eventually find the box, therefore wasting time. This structure of locating the box before moving towards them will save time and increase efficiency. 

## Evaluation of your GROUP'S Final Performance in Relation to the Identified Need
Due to time constraints, this project only got one test. Due to the fact that pybrick code requires a EV3 plugged into the computer in order to run, previously unknown logic and variable errors have emerged. This disabled the code, and was never able to run. Therefore, the actual product does not meet any criteria.  


## Evaluation of Project in Relation to Project Management
Project management, thorughout the duration appreared minimal. This is most evident in the fact that there was not time management, which has contributed to how the project only got to do one test. If project management had been improved, more time will be utilised properly, allowing time to do more tests, and fixes, increasing the quality of this project overall. 


## Evaluation of Project in Relation to Team Collaboration
Teamwork could have been coordinated better. The team had two members working on two very different ideas to accomplish one goal, with only one to be implememnted, instead of two people trying to work on a single idea to accomplish that one goal. This will result in inefficiency not only in wasted energy, but heavy opportunity costs. Such a problem will require much more discussion between team members and may have to go through the trouble of resolving disagreements for it to work better. 


## Identification and Evaluation of Future Improvements to your Final Product
Improvements to the final product may include a way to make sure the modifications of the robot can actually secure the box. This stems from the fact that when the robot turns, centrifugal force causes the box to move away from the robot's protrusions, leaving the robot to then transport nothing back to the start. Eli has worked on an active grabbing mechanism that will actively grab the box. However, due to how compact the robot is, it is not practical to mount this onto the robot. Both solutions both are flawed and a third solution will be required to increase its reliability as well as being able to be put onto the robot.
